            Distraction and Procrastination are the main reason why many cannot get the required marks they want. Moreover, one must have to have the motivation and the ambition to achieve their end goal. </p>

            <p><mark>Solution:</mark>  
            During my stay at this university, I must give all of my effort towards my academic endeavours by not getting deviated and also getting guidance from my mentors.
            To do so, I have to change the way of my approach in almost every aspect of my daily life. Furthermore, I must aim higher than I possibly can so I can be the person I wanted to be.</p>

            <p><mark>Challenges:</mark>
            Laziness and Lack of Time Management is a serious matter, that is not taken into account by many. 
            This can be attributed to poor management skills.
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes, I rely on ‚ÄúRote Learning‚Äù as the right mode of the learning process. 
              But little do I know the fact that this method is worthless in a long run.</p>

            <p><mark>Solution:</mark>  
             I should get rid of this habit of being lazy and be more active rather than a passive person.
             I have to also realise that nothing is more precious than Time and be grateful that I have it.</p>

            <p> Understanding is a key factor in what we learn so that we can remember the concepts more in detail than memorising equations and ideas.
             I must adapt to new ways of learning and also have a curious mind. </p>

            I consider the fact that being egocentric and not listening to the team members is a quality of bad leadership. </p>
            
            <p><mark>Solution:</mark>  
            As a leader of my team, I must be open-minded and respectful and show no partiality to the team members 
            so that everyone will have equal opportunities and succeed in our group projects. </p>

            Poor coordination and lack of engagement in the team can be detrimental to a team.
             In addition to that, misunderstanding among the members can lead to unnecessary conflicts. </p>
            
            <p><mark>Solution:</mark>  
            I must get to know more about my teammates and actively participate in my group as I believe participation 
            is much more than winning. </p>

            Being introverted and shy can be very hard if I want to start a conversation with strangers 
            and also while giving a speech in front of a whole crowd. This can lead to isolation, loneliness and also homesickness. </p>
            
           <p><mark>Solution:</mark>  
            I believe I must engage more time with my classmates and strangers and also talk shows and videos such as 
            TED Talks to gain these skills.</p>
